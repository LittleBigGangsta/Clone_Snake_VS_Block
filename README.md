# I cloned the game "Snake VS Block"
This is a clone of the popular game - "Snake vs Block".

# Details
In the game you control a snake. The snake only moves forward and you can only correct its movement to the right or left. At the start, you only have a head. By collecting points, you can add a tail to the snake. On the way you may come across obstacles in the form of cubes. Each cube has a random strength number. One strength number corresponds to one element of the snake's tail. You need to get to the finish line, collecting the maximum number of points.
